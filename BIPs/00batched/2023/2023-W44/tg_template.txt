gm. A bit late this week as we needed a little more time to review the LayerZero payloads on mainnet and avax.  It's rather important that we exec this week before 00:00 GMT on Thursday.  Your prompt attention is requested.  Please remember to sign the payloads on 2 safes this week.

See detailed report here: https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/BIPs/00batched/2023-W44/combined-report.md

Note the report also has a load for the Karpatkey safe, but we will leave that until next week to facilitate a bit more review of the final, loaded payload.
