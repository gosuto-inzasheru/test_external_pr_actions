BIP-481: Claim and lock vested Aura
BIP-475: Kill ROOT/WETH gauge
BIP-103: Karpatkey October

See detailed report here: https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/BIPs/00batched/2023-W44/combined-report.md

Note the report also has a load for the Karpatkey safe, but we will leave that for another week to facilitate a bit more review of the final, loaded payload.
