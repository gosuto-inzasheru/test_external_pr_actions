In other news:
I'm headed on Holiday tomorrow until the 12th.  So won't be around to pester.  @mikeb can keep an eye on things and exec.   There will also be no signing session next week baring an emergency, next load should be around the 14th of December.  Then we will try to have only 1 more in 2023 and seek to move to a biweekly cadence with some occasionaly extraordinary runs in 2024.
