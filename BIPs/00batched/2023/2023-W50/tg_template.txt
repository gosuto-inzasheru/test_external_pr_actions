gm.  Back in the game.  Was able to detach for the first time in a long time which was nice.  Here's the payloads from the last weeks.  Have to roll out a permissions change on all chains so it's quite a lot.  Would be nice if we could get  mainnet done soon:tm: the rest are less of a rush, but please sometime this week.

See detailed report here: https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/BIPs/00batched/2023-W50/combined-report.md

Also final reminder to let me know if you want to get paid your 500 $BAL for the last half year of multisig service and where.  2 of you have reached out so far with information, I'll assume anyone who does not, does not wish to be paid.
