Gm Gm all.  This week it is very critical that we execute by 23:00 GMT on Wednesday night.  This payload includes relocking a bunch of vlAURA.  If we are late to execute the DAO will loose out on a considerable amount of influence for 1 round and our partners will be... unhappy.  Thanks for your prompt attention this wek.
