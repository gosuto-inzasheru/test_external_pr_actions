GM GM.  This week we have a request to urgently get some BAL to OpCo so they can begin KYC process with market makers.  Those involved have requested us to be as prompt as possible.
Please also review the message directly above for information about a upcoming BIP relating to our group and a bit more info about what is to come over the next couple weeks.
