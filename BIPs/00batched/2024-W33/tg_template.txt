Hello Again! :D   This week we have the some transfers and a revoke of a vesting contract on the DAO multisig that would be best executed soonish.  Also a new roles module on the Karpatkeyu Treasury.  This is a large change.  Feel free to take more time with it if you have questions/want to do a bit more review.
