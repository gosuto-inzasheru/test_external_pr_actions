## English Specification

The transaction details were generated by [this script](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/action-scripts/gen_add_permissions_payload.py) with inputs and outputs in [this directory](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/staging/BIPs/BIP-{BIP_NUMBER})

The following files can be found both linked below and in the payload PR linked above:

# Specification

As described in the payload json, the authorizer will be called to grant the roles as described.  

The change can be reviewed by the below by comparing the [results_deployment_sorted.md](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/staging/{BIP_DIR}/results_deployment_sorted.md) file to the source of truth,  which should match the order found in the source of truth for actionIds on the [balancer-deployments](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-deployments/tree/master/action-ids).

For record, the contents of [results_address_sorted.md](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/staging/{BIP_DIR}/results_address_sorted.md) are printed here:


ADDRESS_SORTED_MD_TABLE

## Risk Assessment
Something should be here...
