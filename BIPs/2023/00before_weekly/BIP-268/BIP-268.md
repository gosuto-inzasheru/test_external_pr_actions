## [Payload PR - BIP-268](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/153)

## Background
The [Child Chain Gauge Factory V2](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20230316-child-chain-gauge-factory-v2) is the Layer Zero replacement for the old Child Chain Streamer style gauges.  These new gauges will enable veBAL boost to be extended to non-mainnet chains.

Beyond emitting BAL, Balancer Gauges have the ability to emit other externally provided tokens.  Projects such as Lido and Polygon have used this capability in the past to provide direct emissions to stakers.

In for a token to be used in a reward gauge, the add_reward function must be called on the gauge with the specified token.  This BIP Grants the Balancer Maxis the ability to manage external rewards tokens on gauges, and authorizes them to make decisions about what tokens to add based on their best judgement and in collaboration with other Balancer Service Providers.

## English Specification

# Specification

As described in the payload json, the authorizer will be called to grant the roles as described.  

The change can be reviewed by the below by comparing the [results_deployment_sorted.md](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/staging/BIPs/BIP-183/results_deployment_sorted.md) file to the source of truth,  which should match the order found in the source of truth for actionIds on the [balancer-v2-monorepo](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/tree/master/pkg/deployments/action-ids).

For record, the contents of [results_address_sorted.md](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/staging/BIPs/BIP-268/results_address_sorted.md) are printed here:

## Risk Assessment
The main risk to adding external tokens to a gauge are that it could be used to distribute spam coins or other mallicious tokens through the gauge system.  The Balancer Maxis have demonstrated themselves as well qualified being both permissive but sensible.
