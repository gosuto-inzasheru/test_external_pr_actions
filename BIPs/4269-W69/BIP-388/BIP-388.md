## Payload PR - BIP-388
https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/405

## Background
Contracts are deployed, and everything is looking good for Balancers launch on Base Chain.   This BIP includes a number of final steps that must be taken to get everything working.

Along with the typical wireup of permissions, the Gauge Factory and Authorizer Wrapper are also being configured, and a 50% protocol fee is being set. 
## English Specification

The transaction details  for `base.json` were generated by [this script](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/action-scripts/gen_add_permissions_payload.py) with inputs and outputs in [this directory](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/staging/BIPs/BIP-388)

# Specification
- `base.json` applies the standard permissions described in the tables above.
- `BIP-388A.json` sets protocol fees to 50%.
- `BIP-388B.json` Wires the Gauge Factory up to the Psuedominter, adding and removing permisisons to do so in the process.
- `BIP-388C.json` Enables the authorizer wrapper, adding and removing permissions to do so in the process. 
## Risk Assessment
This is all part of the standard process for provisioning a new chain.  There are currently no deposits on base chain, this presents to risk to current protocol operations.
